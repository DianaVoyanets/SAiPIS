                    A mountain is a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain in a limited area. 
                    A mountain is generally steeper than a hill, but there is no universally accepted standard definition for the height of a mountain or a hill although a mountain usually has an identifiable summit.
                    Mountains cover 54% of Asia, 36% of North America, 25% of Europe, 22% of South America, 17% of Australia, and 3% of Africa. 
                    As a whole, 24% of the Earth's land mass is mountainous. Also, 1 in 10 people live in mountainous regions. 
                    Most of the world's rivers are fed from mountain sources, and more than half of humanity depends on mountains for water.

                <h3>More about mountains</h3>
                <p>
                    The altitude of mountains means that the tops exist in higher cold layers of the atmosphere.
                    They are consequently often subject to glaciation and erosion through frost action. 
                    This produces the classic mountain peak shape. Some mountains have glacial lakes, created by melting glaciers; for example, there are an estimated 3,000 in Bhutan.
                    Sufficiently tall mountains have very different climatic conditions at the top than at the base, and will thus have different life zones at different altitudes on their slopes.
                    The plants and animals of a zone are somewhat isolated when the zones above and below are inhospitable, and many unique species occur on mountainsides as a result. Extreme cases are known as sky islands. 
                    Cloud forests are forests on mountain sides which attract moisture from the air, creating a unique ecosystem. Very tall mountains may be covered in ice or snow. (From Wikipedia).
